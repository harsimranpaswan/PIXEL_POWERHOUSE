<b>Problem Statement:</b><br>
You are an analyst at a HFT named ABC Capital and you have observed that nowadays quant algo is giving inaccurate predictions. Your boss has asked you to use sentiment analysis for predicting stock performance. You are required to create a NLP based market sentiment meter for NASDAQ stocks using social media posts of normal users. We recommend you to use twitterâ€™s open API to do this.
